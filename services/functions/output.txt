Continuous Metaheuristics for Binary Optimization Problems: An Updated Systematic Literature Review Article Full-text available Dec 2022 Marcelo Orlando Becerra Rozas José Isaac Lemus-Romani Felipe Cisternas-Caneo Jose Garcia Conejeros For years, extensive research has been in the binarization of continuous metaheuristics for solving binary-domain combinatorial problems. This paper is a continuation of a previous review and seeks to draw a comprehensive picture of the various ways to binarize this type of metaheuristics; the study uses a standard systematic review consisting of the analysis of 512 publications from 2017 to January 2022 (5 years). The work will provide a theoretical foundation for novice researchers tackling combinatorial optimization using metaheuristic algorithms and for expert researchers analyzing the binarization mechanism’s impact on the metaheuristic algorithms’ performance. Structuring this information allows for improving the results of metaheuristics and broadening the spectrum of binary problems to be solved. We can conclude from this study that there is no single general technique capable of efficient binarization; instead, there are multiple forms with different performances. View Show abstract ...

Bio-Inspired Swarm Intelligence Optimization Algorithm-Aided Hybrid TDOA/AOA-Based Localization Article Full-text available Apr 2023 Li Cao Haishao Chen Yaodan Chen Xin Zhang A TDOA/AOA hybrid location algorithm based on the crow search algorithm optimized by particle swarm optimization is proposed to address the challenge of solving the nonlinear equation of time of arrival (TDOA/AOA) location in the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environment. This algorithm keeps its optimization mechanism on the basis of enhancing the performance of the original algorithm. To obtain a better fitness value throughout the optimization process and increase the algorithm’s optimization accuracy, the fitness function based on maximum likelihood estimation is modified. In order to speed up algorithm convergence and decrease needless global search without compromising population diversity, an initial solution is simultaneously added to the starting population location. Simulation findings demonstrate that the suggested method outperforms the TDOA/AOA algorithm and other comparable algorithms, including Taylor, Chan, PSO, CPSO, and basic CSA algorithms. The approach performs well in terms of robustness, convergence speed, and node positioning accuracy. View Show abstract ... In addition, FS is one of the problems that is solved using CSA algorithm.

Improving binary crow search algorithm for feature selection Article Full-text available Feb 2023 Zakaria Hamed Zakariya Algamal The feature selection (FS) process has an essential effect in solving many problems such as prediction, regression, and classification to get the optimal solution. For solving classification problems, selecting the most relevant features of a dataset leads to better classification accuracy with low training time. In this work, a hybrid binary crow search algorithm (BCSA) based quasi-oppositional (QO) method is proposed as an FS method based on wrapper mode to solve a classification problem. The QO method was employed in tuning the value of flight length in the BCSA which is controlling the ability of the crows to find the optimal solution. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, four benchmark datasets have been used which are human intestinal absorption, HDAC8 inhibitory activity (IC50), P-glycoproteins, and antimicrobial. Accordingly, the experimental results are discussed and compared against other standard algorithms based on the accuracy rate, the average number of selected features, and running time. The results have proven the robustness of the proposed method relied on the high obtained value of accuracy (84.93–95.92%), G-mean (0.853–0.971%), and average selected features (4.36–11.8) with a relatively low computational time. Moreover, to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method, Friedman test was used which declared that the performance supremacy of the proposed BCSA-QO with four datasets was very evident against BCSA and CSA by selecting the minimum relevant features and producing the highest accuracy classification rate. The obtained results verify the usefulness of the proposed method (BCSA-QO) in the FS with classification in terms of high classification accuracy, a small number of selected features, and low computational time.

The early detection of PD is necessary for proper treatment of patients and for providing them better health care services. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system is a non-invasive and low-cost tool which have the potential to help in the diagnosis and monitoring of various diseases. Handwriting is important in the context of PD assessment. For the early detection of this disease, a number of machine learning techniques have been researched. Yet the main problem with the majority of these manual feature extraction methods is their poor performance and accuracy. To deal with this chronic condition, we need a Deep Learning (DL) model that can help in early diagnosis. In order to accomplish this, we propose a hybrid method that incorporates technique for data augmentation, feature extraction with pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), feature selection using optimization and classification with the help of Machine Learning to enhance PD identification. In this paper firstly, all types of handwriting images (circle, spiral and meander) are fed into six different pretrained models of CNN and are fine-tuned for classification among which VGG16 framework provides the better performance among the others. In the second stage, Binary grey wolf optimization (BGWO) is used for the selection of optimal subset of features extracted from VGG16 network by freezing the layers. The proposed method achieves classification accuracy of 99.8% using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The performance of our approach has been measured over the benchmark NewHandPD dataset. The experimental result shows that the proposed approach detects Parkinson's disease better than state-of-the-art methods by minimizing the feature subsets and thereby maximizing the accuracy. View Show abstract CCOCSA-based multi-frame sparse coding super-resolution via mutual information-based weighted image fusion Article Full-text available May 2023 MULTIMED TOOLS APPL Amit Mukhopadhyay Debashis Nandi Umapada Pal Baisakhi Chakraborty Image super-resolution (SR) is one of the most urgent requirements in many applications in computer vision. Though many techniques have been proposed to date, they are not suitable in real-life applications because of their lack of performance when the low resolution (LR) images are noisy. In the single-frame SR mechanism, the output image can not reproduce the information which is lost due to sub-sampling at the time of image formation. Multi-frame image SR technique can solve this problem to a reasonable extent. However, most of the multi-frame image SR techniques are based on image registration which is noise sensitive. The registration errors in noisy LR images deteriorate the performance of the registration process and hence the performance of the multi-frame SR algorithms. This paper addresses this problem and proposes a novel mutual information-based multi-frame sparse coding super-resolution via Chaotic Centroid-Oppositional Crow Search Optimization Algorithm (CCOCSA)-based image registration. The proposed SR algorithm is accomplished in two steps: (1) CCOCSA-based image registration and (2) Mutual information based weighted mean multi-frame super-resolution reconstruction through sparse representation. The proposed CCOCSA is a noise-robust optimization that provides better accuracy in estimating registration parameters. We achieve this by enhancing the exploration by dynamically varying the control parameters and introducing chaos within the algorithm. The weighted mean of the registered LR frames based on mutual information provides a good noise reduction capability. Also, it gathers the information from all the LR frames on the registered weighted mean frame, which enriches the information in the reconstructed SR image. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested through the experiments on four benchmark datasets (Vid4, McMaster, Milanfar, and Kodak) for videos and still images. We verify the performance of the proposed technique by computing four well-known quality metrics, such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Edge Keeping Index (EKI), blur-metric, and Perceptual SIMilarity (PSIM) measure. The experimental results show that the proposed SR algorithm outperforms the others quantitatively and qualitatively.

Albuquerque Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease at its early stage is important in proper treatment of the patients so they can lead productive lives for as long as possible. Although many techniques have been proposed to diagnose the Parkinson's disease at an early stage but none of them are efficient.

January 2003 · Lecture Notes in Computer Science Antonio Fernández-Caballero Víctor López-Jaquero Francisco Montero Pascual González In this paper we propose to include two up-to-date separate concepts, namely social computing and usability metrics, in intelligent interaction agents to enhance a user-centred, adaptive human-computer interaction (HCI) on the Web. Social computing refers to the application of sociological understanding to the design of interactive systems. Usability metrics are software quality metrics with a ...

Driven by the impression that a narrow focus on interactive products as tools does not capture the variety and emerging ... [Show full abstract] aspects of technology use, practitioners and researchers alike, seem to readily embrace the notion of UX as a viable alternative to traditional HCI. And, indeed, the term promises change and a fresh look, without being too specific about its definite meaning. The present introduction to the special issue on 'Empirical studies of the user experience' attempts to give a provisional answer to the question of what is meant by 'the user experience'. It provides a cursory sketch of UX and how we think UX research will look like in the future. It is not so much meant as a forecast of the future, but as a proposal – a stimulus for further UX research.

interface. Unfortunately, the software industry market their product

packages so complex that many of the facilities remain unknown to the

Materials and Methods: In this retrospective analysis from 3 tertiary care centers in India, consecutive intermediate-/high-risk carcinoma penis (CaP) patients with nonpalpable inguinal lymphadenopathy and/or nonbulky (<3 cm) mobile inguinal lymphadenopathy undergoing RA-VEIL were included. Patients with matted/bulky (>3 cm) and fixed lymphadenopathy were excluded. Demographic, clinical, and intraoperative data were recorded. Perioperative complications were graded by the Clavien-Dindo classification (CDC). The International Society of Lymphology (ISL) {0-III} grading was used for the assessment of lymphedema. Incidence and pattern of recurrences were assessed on follow-up. Results: From January 1, 2011, to September 30, 2023, 115 patients (230 groins) underwent bilateral RA-VEIL for CaP. The median age of the cohort was 60 (50-69) years. Clinically palpable (either unilateral or bilateral) inguinal lymphadenopathy was seen in 54 patients (47%). The "per groin" median operative time was 120 (100-140) minutes with median lymph node yield of 12 (9-16). No complications were recorded in 87.8% groins operated, with major complications (CDC 3) seen in 2.6% groins. At a median follow-up of 13.5 months, 13 patients had documented recurrences and there were 10 cancer-related deaths. No port-site recurrences were observed. No/minimal lymphedema (ISL 0/I) was seen in 94% legs. Conclusion: RA-VEIL demonstrates safety and oncologic efficacy in penile cancer patients presenting with clinically nonpalpable and/or nonbulky inguinal lymphadenopathy, with favorable functional outcomes.

The deformation behavior of such composite materials due to the high plastic deformation of the matrix differs from the behavior of traditional composites, which must be considered when performing calculations. In our study, as a model object, the features of the microstructure of single carbon thread impregnated with polysulfone were studied in order to evaluate the distribution of misorientation angles of elementary fibers, the degree of their damage, the thickness of the polymer matrix interlayers between elementary fibers in threads impregnated with more viscous thermoplastic binders. Statistical analysis of a large array of micrographs was carried out using specially developed algorithms for computer processing of electron microscopic images of a composite material. Algorithms for processing arrays of images using machine vision algorithms are proposed. Based on the analysis of the data array, the distributions of carbon fibers impregnated with polysulfone were plotted over the misorientation angle of the filaments and over the interfilament distance in the longitudinal and cross sections of the fiber. Using the machine learning method, an algorithm for detecting violations of the filament structure was implemented. The data obtained can be used to refine the calculations of the strength and deformation characteristics of composite materials with thermoplastic matrices.

However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided biopsies have been shown to have superior diagnostic performance. MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy improves the detection by combining the systematic and the targeted biopsies (TB). In this study, we evaluated the role of fusion biopsy in the detection of CaP as well as clinically significant carcinoma prostate (CsCaP). Methods: In this retrospective study, the patients who underwent fusion biopsy from January 2016 to July 2022 were evaluated. Patients underwent multiparametric MRI and the suspicious lesions were reported as per the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) version 2. The clinical, imaging, and biopsy parameters were recorded and evaluated. Results: A total of 330 patients with PIRADS ≥3 underwent MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy and prostate cancer was detected in 187 patients (56.67%). With an increase in the PIRADS score, there was a significant rise in the detection of CaP ( P < 0.001) and CsCaP ( P < 0.0000001). Prostatitis was observed in 13%-18.1% of the patients with a lesion on MRI irrespective of the PIRADS score. The systematic and TB were comparable for the detection of CaP ( P = 0.88) and CsCaP ( P = 0.26). With a prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) cutoff of 0.15 ng/mL/cc and 0.22 ng/mL/cc, biopsy could be safely avoided in 14.2% and 20.3% of the patients, missing only 0.3% of CaP and 0.9% of CsCaP, respectively. Different subgroups based on PSA levels, prostate volume, lesion dimension, and PIRADS score did not show a significant difference between the systematic and the targeted cores for the detection of CsCaP. Conclusion: This single center study of MRI-TRUS fusion prostate biopsy shows that in men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer a pre-biopsy MRI and MRI-TRUS fusion combined systematic and targeted prostate biopsy improves the detection of prostate cancer and CsCaP. Patients with a PIRADS 3 lesion with a PSA density <0.22 can safely avoid prostate biopsy, without a significant risk of missing clinically significant prostate cancer.
